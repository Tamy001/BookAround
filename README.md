# --------------  INITIALIZATION  ---------------- #

┌─── GETTING STARTED ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
|                                                                                                  |
|    1️⃣ Initialize Packages: Begin by fetching all necessary packages.                             |
|       Execute the following in your terminal: `flutter pub get`.                                 |
|                                                                                                  |
|    2️⃣ SDK Version Check: Ensure you have the correct Dart SDK version.                           |
|       [Note]: `The current Dart SDK version is 2.18.6`.                                          |
|       [Error]: Might be `t_store requires SDK version >=3.0.5 <4.0.0`.                           |
|       This indicates version solving has failed due to a mismatch.                               |
|       [Solution]: Upgrade Flutter - To rectify SDK version mismatches and stay updated,          |
|       run: `flutter upgrade`. This command will fetch and install all the required updates.      |
|                                                                                                  |
|    3️⃣ Lastly, ensure all dependencies are properly set.                                          |
|       Execute `flutter pub get`.                                                                 |
|       On successful completion, you're primed and ready to launch the application.               |
|                                                                                                  |
